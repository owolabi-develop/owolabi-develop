### Hi 👋 ! I'm Owolabi
### Python Backend & Full-Stack Developer | Agentic & Generative AI Engineer
### About Me :

I’m a Python Backend and Full-Stack Developer with 5+ years of experience building scalable, production-ready APIs and backend systems. I specialize in backend development with FastAPI and Django, designing clean, maintainable services that power real-world applications.

I’ve worked on systems including job portals, AI-driven insurance claim processing, and automated quote platforms, where reliability, performance, and data integrity are critical. I also build agentic and generative AI applications, integrating LLMs into backend services for RAG, intelligent automation, and workflow orchestration, with a strong focus on engineering fundamentals rather than framework dependency.

My background in database design, SQL optimization, and backend performance enables me to deliver systems that scale reliably in production.
