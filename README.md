### Hi ðŸ‘‹ ! I'm Owolabi
### Full stack developer Data Engineer
### About Me :

I am working as a full stack developer and  Data Engineer. I develop many data engineering projects with the below tools and frameworks. I start working on the projects and jobs with a can-do approach and try to find the best practices while handling the tasks. I believe that theoretical side of the data is quite important. That's why I learn the principles of distributed computing, big data practices, best approaches in streaming data, scheduling pipelines, best practices of cloud environments and many other topics. While doing those, I also develop myself in coding especially at Python and SQL. I create many complicated Python scripts as well as many SQL queries. You can find lots of data full stack and engineering projects here, welcome to my GitHub :
